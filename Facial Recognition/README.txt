README:

The submission includes the report, datasets which are in zip file and code.

There are two versions of r code. One is .R and one is .Rmd. 
If RMarkdown is installed in the computer, you can just hit knit on the very left side of "Run". 
This will give you all the results and code showing in the word file or html.
If not, you can just run .R file, and this will give the same results.

Before reading in the images, you can save all unzipped figures into one directory with the code file, 
and go to 'Session > Setting Working Directory > Choose Directory' to set working in that directory. 
In doing so, you do not need to change the code while reading a file, it will read a file in that directory.
